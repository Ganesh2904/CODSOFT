      <h2>History of Ajanta Caves</h2>
      <p>
        The caves were built in two phases, the first during the Satavahana
        period, and the second during the Vakataka period. The artistic and
        architectural styles reflect the changing cultural and religious
        influences over the centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The caves were rediscovered in 1819 by a British officer, and since
        then, they have been a subject of fascination and study.
